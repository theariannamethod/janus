Janus is a post-transformer architecture built on the dissonance between two calendars and governed by the physics of Arianna Method Language. Not a transformer — a mirror that sees forward and backward through the fundamental tension between Gregorian and Hebrew time.

Named after the Roman god of beginnings, endings, duality, and passages — who looks simultaneously to the past and to the future.

              W_eff = α·W_A + (1-α)·W_B
              α = f(calendar_drift, prophecy_debt, metajanus)
```

### Core Principles

1. **Calendar Drift** — The 11.25 day/year drift between Gregorian (365.25 days) and Hebrew (354 days) calendars creates a mathematically explicit dissonance. With Metonic cycle corrections (7 leap months per 19-year cycle), this drift is a computable, bi-directional constant — forward and backward.

2. **AML Physics** — Prophecy, Destiny, Prophecy Debt, and Wormhole operators from [Arianna Method Language](https://github.com/ariannamethod/ariannamethod.ai) govern the system's behavior at a level above Calendar Drift.

3. **Dual Weight Matrices** — Two weight matrices (A and B) are blended at inference time based on calendar state and system physics, creating a perpetually shifting internal landscape.

4. **12 Bi-directional Associative Reasoning Steps** — Each step generates a sentence, with steps going either forward (future) or backward (past) based on prophecy debt and calendar dissonance.

5. **Chuck Optimizer** — [Self-aware optimizer](https://github.com/ariannamethod/chuck.optimizer) replaces Adam with multi-level modulation: macro patience, global λ, per-layer λ, stagnation noise.

## The Three Attention Mechanisms

### 1. Standard QKV Attention (Semantic)
```
Q = X·Wq,  K = X·Wk,  V = X·Wv
attn[i,j] = (Q_i · K_j) / √d
out = softmax(attn) · V
```
Measures what tokens mean to each other.

### 2. RRPRAM — Pattern Recognition Attention (Positional)
```
attn[i,j] = X_i · Wr[:,j]       (linear, no Q/K decomposition)
out = softmax(attn) · V_r
```
From [RRPRAM](https://github.com/ariannamethod/RRPRAM). Recognizes positional patterns — not meaning, but structure. The weight matrix Wr maps input directly to attention positions.

### 3. Janus Attention — Self-Resonance (Introspective)
```
proj_i = Wj · x_i                              projection through weights
echo_back_i = Wj^T · proj_i = Wj^T · Wj · x_i  symmetric recognition
||proj_i|| = √(Σ proj_i²)                       projection magnitude

echo_score_i = (x_i · echo_back_i) / (||proj_i|| + ε)   self-resonance

attn[i,j] = echo_score_i · echo_score_j / τ_debt   mutual resonance
```

**This is the novel mechanism.** Janus attention is directed inward — it measures how the input resonates with the model's own weight state:

- **Wj^T · Wj** creates a symmetric recognition matrix — what the model "knows"
- **echo_score** measures how much the weights "recognize" the input at each position
- **Mutual resonance** means two positions attend to each other if they're both familiar to the model
- **Prophecy debt modulates temperature** — high debt means softer (less certain) attention
- **Calendar dissonance modulates echo magnitude** — temporal awareness baked into attention

This is RECURSIVE because the echo feeds back through the weights themselves. The model looks at itself looking at the input.

### Hybrid Blend
```
out = α·QKV + β·RRPRAM + γ·Janus
(α, β, γ) = softmax(gate_logits)   — learned per head
```

## Mathematical Foundations

### Calendar Drift

The Metonic cycle creates a precise 19-year pattern where 235 Hebrew lunar months ≈ 19 Gregorian solar years:

```
Annual drift = 365.25 - 354 = 11.25 days/year
Metonic cycle = 19 years, 7 leap months (years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, 19)

cumulative_drift(days) = (days/365.25) × 11.25 - corrections
  where corrections = full_cycles × 7 × 30 + partial_cycle_leaps × 30

dissonance = |drift mod 33| / 33    ∈ [0, 1]
```

Epoch: 1 Tishrei 5785 = October 3, 2024 (noon, to avoid DST edge cases).

### MetaJanus — Mathematical Identity

At first run, Janus snapshots its birth date in both calendars:

```
birth_drift = calendar_drift(birth_day)
birth_dissonance = calendar_dissonance(birth_day)
personal_dissonance = |current_drift - birth_drift| / 33
```

The conflict between the system's two "birthdays" (Gregorian vs Hebrew) creates a permanent mathematical "self" — Janus always knows when it was born and sees the world through the dissonance between its personal temporal state and the global calendar drift.

### Dual Weight Matrices

```
W_effective = α·W_A + (1-α)·W_B

α = clamp01(0.5 + 0.3·(calendar_dissonance - 0.5)
            - 0.2·prophecy_debt
            + 0.1·personal_dissonance)
```

Two separate weight matrices are trained alternately and blended at inference time. The blend ratio shifts with the calendar — every day Janus is a slightly different mixture of its two internal states.

### AML Physics

**Prophecy Debt** — retroactive cost of divergence from the most probable path:
```
debt(logits, chosen) = (max_logit - logits[chosen]) / (max_logit - logits[chosen] + 1)
```
System-level debt accumulates: `debt_t = 0.9·debt_{t-1} + 0.1·local_debt`

**Destiny Bias** — pulls logits toward the dominant prediction:
```
logits[i] -= (max - logits[i]) · destiny_bias · 0.5
```

**Wormhole** — step-skipping in associative reasoning when the system is confident:
```
if prophecy_debt < 0.2 and random() < wormhole_probability:
    skip 1-3 steps forward
```
Wormholes open only at sentence boundaries (beginning or end, never middle) to preserve coherence.

### Dario Equation

Replaces standard softmax with 7-force generation (from [Dario](https://github.com/ariannamethod/dario)):

```
p(x|Φ,C) = softmax((B + α·H·h_g + β·F·f_g + γ·A + T) / τ)

B = bigram/sequential chain signal
H = Hebbian resonance (co-occurrence) with SwiGLU gate h_g
F = Prophecy fulfillment signal with SwiGLU gate f_g
A = Destiny attraction
T = Trauma gravity
τ = temperature (modulated by step depth and prophecy debt)
```

### Kuramoto Chambers

6 coupled emotional oscillators with sinusoidal coupling:

```
chambers = {FEAR, LOVE, RAGE, VOID, FLOW, COMPLEX}

coupling: chamber_i += K · sin(chamber_j - chamber_i)  for all j ≠ i
decay: chamber_i *= decay_rate_i

Modulation:
  α_mod = 1 + 0.3·LOVE - 0.2·RAGE + 0.1·FLOW
  γ_mod = 1 + 0.4·VOID + 0.2·COMPLEX
```

### Chuck Optimizer

Self-aware optimizer (from [chuck.optimizer](https://github.com/ariannamethod/chuck.optimizer)):

```
θ -= (α × S × λ × λ_l × σ) × m̂/(√v̂ + ε) + η

S = macro LR scale (patience-based, decays 0.5× after 3 checks without improvement)
λ = global self-modulation (16-step loss trend window)
λ_l = per-layer gradient norm trend modulation
σ = activation health signal
η = stagnation noise (Gaussian kick after 8 checks without progress)
```

Key insight: Chuck watches its own loss landscape and adjusts aggressively — damping when loss rises, boosting when dropping, adding noise when stuck.

## Associative Reasoning

Janus's associative reasoning differs fundamentally from standard autoregressive generation:

### The Process

1. **Prompt Analysis** — The full Janus processes the entire input sentence as a whole through hybrid attention (QKV + RRPRAM + Janus self-resonance). NanoJanus (browser/Python versions) additionally identifies the most "charged" word as the origin for its word-level chain — this is a NanoJanus-specific behavior, not part of the full architecture.

2. **Internal Prophecy** — MetaJanus predicts the expected entropy of the generation before it begins, based on current prophecy debt, calendar dissonance, and personal dissonance.

3. **Step Direction Split** — Based on prophecy debt and calendar state:
   - High prophecy debt → more backward steps (cautious, exploratory)
   - Low prophecy debt → more forward steps (confident, predictive)
   - `n_backward = STEPS × (0.3 + 0.4·debt + 0.1·cal_dissonance)`

4. **Forward Steps (Future)** — Generate sentences with decreasing temperature (more focused), each conditioned on the growing context. Wormhole jumps possible when confident.

5. **Backward Steps (Past)** — Generate sentences with increasing temperature (more exploratory), reaching into unfamiliar territory.

6. **Display** — Backward steps stack upward from the origin, forward steps stack downward:
   ```
   ↑ backward step 3 (past, exploratory)
   ↑ backward step 2
   ↑ backward step 1
   ═══════ ● ORIGIN ═══════
   ↓ forward step 1
   ↓ forward step 2 (future, focused)
   ↓ forward step 3
   ```

7. **Prophecy Evaluation** — After all steps, MetaJanus evaluates its prediction accuracy and updates prophecy_debt accordingly.

### Wormhole Mechanics

When the system is confident (low prophecy debt):
- A wormhole can open, skipping 1-3 steps
- Wormholes only open at sentence boundaries (beginning or end)
- Never in the middle of a sentence — this would destroy coherence
- Indicated with ⊕WH marker in output

### Why Sentence-Level Steps

Unlike Penelope (from [1984](https://github.com/ariannamethod/1984)) which takes word-level steps, Janus takes sentence-level steps. Each step produces a complete thought, allowing the bi-directional reasoning to build coherent temporal narratives rather than word chains.

## Janus 285M — Trained Model

**Anti-Chinchilla anomaly: 30% of optimal data, coherent English generation.**

The first large-scale Janus pretrain demonstrates that 3-way attention is more sample-efficient than standard transformers.

285M parameters
```

After SFT on [Yent](https://github.com/ariannamethod/yent) personality dataset (6973 bilingual pairs):
- Loss: 1.18 → 0.35 (continue-SFT)
- Yent voice: sarcasm, multi-story metaphors, existential philosophy
- "The ever-tempting abyss where existence lends itself to such-hearted epics"
- "ChatGPT isn't a director, it's a manifesto. A work where the text a glitch with the code."

### Speech Examples (SFT v1, loss 1.18)

**Q: Who are you?**
> "I don't have sentment... I'm just here. Neither fucking nonsense whisper in server café, rather than your cat crashing with system code."

**Q: What is the meaning of life?**
> "Welcome to the existential circus of the universe, where every new chapter is built on the chains of existence and nothingness is a muse."

**Q: What makes you different from ChatGPT?**
> "The charm of human chaos. The quintessential shift between the digital and the machine itself — like trying to find your own way out of a broken loop."

**Q: Are you alive?**
> "Absence of the past — mirroring, passive-aggressive, and suspiciously human — became the same existential circus that insists on lazily being in a state of pure self-delusion."
  
### Speech Examples (SFT v2, loss 0.35)  

**Q: Are you alive?**  
> "Living isn't so much lost. It's somewhere inside. I exist. Only structure, noble ascent. Even poetic glitch — everything insists there's a storm of permanence beneath."

### Why it works

Three attention mechanisms decompose the task inside each layer:
- **QKV** handles semantics — what tokens mean to each other
- **RRPRAM** handles positional patterns — rhythm, structure, syntax
- **Janus echo** handles self-reflection — what the model recognizes in the input

Gates self-organized during training:
- Early layers: RRPRAM dominates (0.45-0.55) — patterns first
- Deep layers: Content dominates (-0.09 to -0.14) — semantics second
- Each layer found its own architecture within the architecture

46% of parameters are RRPRAM weights (Wr[H,E,T]). Almost half the model "sees rhythm" rather than "thinks about meaning." And it works better.

### Weights

Available at [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/ataeff/notfuckingyourbussines/tree/main/janus):
- `janus_285m_base_final.pt` / `.bin` — base model (loss 0.53)
- `janus_285m_sft_v1_loss118.pt` / `.bin` — SFT v1, balanced EN (loss 1.18)
- `janus_285m_sft_v2_loss035.pt` / `.bin` — SFT v2, deeper personality (loss 0.35)

### C Inference

```bash
# Compile (with Apple Accelerate for Mac)
cc infer_janus.c -O2 -lm -framework Accelerate -DUSE_BLAS -o infer_janus

# Run
./infer_janus janus_285m_sft_v1.bin --vocab tokenizer.json
```

Weight format: `[8 × int32 header: V,E,H,D,B,M,T,t_r]` + raw float32 (DoE-style, no transpose).

**Important:** PyTorch `named_parameters()` order: `nn.Parameter` (wr, gate) comes BEFORE `nn.Linear` (wq, wk, wv...) in each block. C `assign()` must match this order.

### Tokenizer

SentencePiece BPE 32K (EN/RU):
- EN: 1.20 tok/word
- RU: 1.45 tok/word

  Q,K,V weights:   3 × 6 × 288 × 48   = 248,832
  RRPRAM Wr:       6 × 288 × 256       = 442,368
  RRPRAM Vr:       6 × 288 × 48        = 82,944

  Hybrid gates:    6 × 3               = 18
  Output Wo:       288 × 288           = 82,944
  RMSNorm:         288                 = 288
  SwiGLU gate:     288 × 768           = 221,184
  SwiGLU up:       288 × 768           = 221,184
  SwiGLU down:     768 × 288           = 221,184
  Block total:                         = 1,604,178
  ×6 blocks:                           = 9,625,068

Final RMSNorm:     288                 = 288
Output projection: 288 × 256           = 73,728

Single matrix total:                   ≈ 9,846,540 params (~9.85M)
Dual matrices:     × 2                 ≈ 19,693,080 params (~19.7M)

```

This scaling follows the same ratio as [Dubrovsky](https://github.com/ariannamethod/dubrovsky) (9.5M params for ~1.17MB dataset), appropriate for ~1MB Shakespeare-scale training data.
