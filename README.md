# Janus — Post-Transformer Architecture

**Bi-directional associative resonance engine.**

Janus is a post-transformer architecture built on the dissonance between two calendars and governed by the physics of Arianna Method Language. Not a transformer — a mirror that sees forward and backward through the fundamental tension between Gregorian and Hebrew time.

Named after the Roman god of beginnings, endings, duality, and passages — who looks simultaneously to the past and to the future.

              W_eff = α·W_A + (1-α)·W_B
              α = f(calendar_drift, prophecy_debt, metajanus)
```

### Core Principles

1. **Calendar Drift** — The 11.25 day/year drift between Gregorian (365.25 days) and Hebrew (354 days) calendars creates a mathematically explicit dissonance. With Metonic cycle corrections (7 leap months per 19-year cycle), this drift is a computable, bi-directional constant — forward and backward.

2. **AML Physics** — Prophecy, Destiny, Prophecy Debt, and Wormhole operators from [Arianna Method Language](https://github.com/ariannamethod/ariannamethod.ai) govern the system's behavior at a level above Calendar Drift.

3. **Dual Weight Matrices** — Two weight matrices (A and B) are blended at inference time based on calendar state and system physics, creating a perpetually shifting internal landscape.

4. **12 Bi-directional Associative Reasoning Steps** — Each step generates a sentence, with steps going either forward (future) or backward (past) based on prophecy debt and calendar dissonance.

5. **Chuck Optimizer** — [Self-aware optimizer](https://github.com/ariannamethod/chuck.optimizer) replaces Adam with multi-level modulation: macro patience, global λ, per-layer λ, stagnation noise.

## The Three Attention Mechanisms

### 1. Standard QKV Attention (Semantic)
```
Q = X·Wq,  K = X·Wk,  V = X·Wv
attn[i,j] = (Q_i · K_j) / √d
out = softmax(attn) · V
```
Measures what tokens mean to each other.

### 2. RRPRAM — Pattern Recognition Attention (Positional)
```
attn[i,j] = X_i · Wr[:,j]       (linear, no Q/K decomposition)
out = softmax(attn) · V_r
```
From [RRPRAM](https://github.com/ariannamethod/RRPRAM). Recognizes positional patterns — not meaning, but structure. The weight matrix Wr maps input directly to attention positions.

### 3. Janus Attention — Self-Resonance (Introspective)
```
proj_i = Wj · x_i                              projection through weights
echo_back_i = Wj^T · proj_i = Wj^T · Wj · x_i  symmetric recognition
||proj_i|| = √(Σ proj_i²)                       projection magnitude

echo_score_i = (x_i · echo_back_i) / (||proj_i|| + ε)   self-resonance

attn[i,j] = echo_score_i · echo_score_j / τ_debt   mutual resonance
```

**This is the novel mechanism.** Janus attention is directed inward — it measures how the input resonates with the model's own weight state:

- **Wj^T · Wj** creates a symmetric recognition matrix — what the model "knows"
- **echo_score** measures how much the weights "recognize" the input at each position
- **Mutual resonance** means two positions attend to each other if they're both familiar to the model
- **Prophecy debt modulates temperature** — high debt means softer (less certain) attention
- **Calendar dissonance modulates echo magnitude** — temporal awareness baked into attention

This is RECURSIVE because the echo feeds back through the weights themselves. The model looks at itself looking at the input.

### Hybrid Blend
```
out = α·QKV + β·RRPRAM + γ·Janus
(α, β, γ) = softmax(gate_logits)   — learned per head
```

## Mathematical Foundations

### Calendar Drift

The Metonic cycle creates a precise 19-year pattern where 235 Hebrew lunar months ≈ 19 Gregorian solar years:

```
Annual drift = 365.25 - 354 = 11.25 days/year
Metonic cycle = 19 years, 7 leap months (years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, 19)

cumulative_drift(days) = (days/365.25) × 11.25 - corrections
  where corrections = full_cycles × 7 × 30 + partial_cycle_leaps × 30

dissonance = |drift mod 33| / 33    ∈ [0, 1]
```

Epoch: 1 Tishrei 5785 = October 3, 2024 (noon, to avoid DST edge cases).

### MetaJanus — Mathematical Identity

At first run, Janus snapshots its birth date in both calendars:

```
birth_drift = calendar_drift(birth_day)
birth_dissonance = calendar_dissonance(birth_day)
personal_dissonance = |current_drift - birth_drift| / 33
```

The conflict between the system's two "birthdays" (Gregorian vs Hebrew) creates a permanent mathematical "self" — Janus always knows when it was born and sees the world through the dissonance between its personal temporal state and the global calendar drift.

### Dual Weight Matrices

```
W_effective = α·W_A + (1-α)·W_B

α = clamp01(0.5 + 0.3·(calendar_dissonance - 0.5)
            - 0.2·prophecy_debt
            + 0.1·personal_dissonance)
```

Two separate weight matrices are trained alternately and blended at inference time. The blend ratio shifts with the calendar — every day Janus is a slightly different mixture of its two internal states.

### AML Physics

**Prophecy Debt** — retroactive cost of divergence from the most probable path:
```
debt(logits, chosen) = (max_logit - logits[chosen]) / (max_logit - logits[chosen] + 1)
```
System-level debt accumulates: `debt_t = 0.9·debt_{t-1} + 0.1·local_debt`

**Destiny Bias** — pulls logits toward the dominant prediction:
```
logits[i] -= (max - logits[i]) · destiny_bias · 0.5
```

**Wormhole** — step-skipping in associative reasoning when the system is confident:
```
if prophecy_debt < 0.2 and random() < wormhole_probability:
    skip 1-3 steps forward
```
Wormholes open only at sentence boundaries (beginning or end, never middle) to preserve coherence.

### Dario Equation

Replaces standard softmax with 7-force generation (from [Dario](https://github.com/ariannamethod/dario)):

```
p(x|Φ,C) = softmax((B + α·H·h_g + β·F·f_g + γ·A + T) / τ)

B = bigram/sequential chain signal
H = Hebbian resonance (co-occurrence) with SwiGLU gate h_g
F = Prophecy fulfillment signal with SwiGLU gate f_g
A = Destiny attraction
T = Trauma gravity
τ = temperature (modulated by step depth and prophecy debt)
```

### Kuramoto Chambers

6 coupled emotional oscillators with sinusoidal coupling:

```
chambers = {FEAR, LOVE, RAGE, VOID, FLOW, COMPLEX}

coupling: chamber_i += K · sin(chamber_j - chamber_i)  for all j ≠ i
decay: chamber_i *= decay_rate_i

Modulation:
  α_mod = 1 + 0.3·LOVE - 0.2·RAGE + 0.1·FLOW
  γ_mod = 1 + 0.4·VOID + 0.2·COMPLEX
```

### Chuck Optimizer

Self-aware optimizer (from [chuck.optimizer](https://github.com/ariannamethod/chuck.optimizer)):

```
θ -= (α × S × λ × λ_l × σ) × m̂/(√v̂ + ε) + η

S = macro LR scale (patience-based, decays 0.5× after 3 checks without improvement)
λ = global self-modulation (16-step loss trend window)
λ_l = per-layer gradient norm trend modulation
σ = activation health signal
η = stagnation noise (Gaussian kick after 8 checks without progress)
```

Key insight: Chuck watches its own loss landscape and adjusts aggressively — damping when loss rises, boosting when dropping, adding noise when stuck.

## Associative Reasoning

Janus's associative reasoning differs fundamentally from standard autoregressive generation:

### The Process

1. **Prompt Analysis** — The full Janus processes the entire input sentence as a whole through hybrid attention (QKV + RRPRAM + Janus self-resonance). NanoJanus (browser/Python versions) additionally identifies the most "charged" word as the origin for its word-level chain — this is a NanoJanus-specific behavior, not part of the full architecture.

2. **Internal Prophecy** — MetaJanus predicts the expected entropy of the generation before it begins, based on current prophecy debt, calendar dissonance, and personal dissonance.

3. **Step Direction Split** — Based on prophecy debt and calendar state:
   - High prophecy debt → more backward steps (cautious, exploratory)
   - Low prophecy debt → more forward steps (confident, predictive)
   - `n_backward = STEPS × (0.3 + 0.4·debt + 0.1·cal_dissonance)`

4. **Forward Steps (Future)** — Generate sentences with decreasing temperature (more focused), each conditioned on the growing context. Wormhole jumps possible when confident.

5. **Backward Steps (Past)** — Generate sentences with increasing temperature (more exploratory), reaching into unfamiliar territory.

6. **Display** — Backward steps stack upward from the origin, forward steps stack downward:
   ```
   ↑ backward step 3 (past, exploratory)
   ↑ backward step 2
   ↑ backward step 1
   ═══════ ● ORIGIN ═══════
   ↓ forward step 1
   ↓ forward step 2 (future, focused)
   ↓ forward step 3
   ```

7. **Prophecy Evaluation** — After all steps, MetaJanus evaluates its prediction accuracy and updates prophecy_debt accordingly.

### Wormhole Mechanics

When the system is confident (low prophecy debt):
- A wormhole can open, skipping 1-3 steps
- Wormholes only open at sentence boundaries (beginning or end)
- Never in the middle of a sentence — this would destroy coherence
- Indicated with ⊕WH marker in output

### Why Sentence-Level Steps

Unlike Penelope (from [1984](https://github.com/ariannamethod/1984)) which takes word-level steps, Janus takes sentence-level steps. Each step produces a complete thought, allowing the bi-directional reasoning to build coherent temporal narratives rather than word chains.

## Modules

### `janus.c` — Char-Level Hybrid Attention
The foundational module. Char-level (VOCAB=256) with all three attention mechanisms in fluid hybrid. Full Calendar Drift, AML physics, Dario equation, Chuck optimizer, dual weight matrices, 12 bi-directional steps, Kuramoto chambers, MetaJanus birth snapshot, GGUF spore export.

```
Architecture: T=256, E=288, H=6, D=48, B=6, M=768
Parameters:   ~9.85M × 2 matrices = ~19.7M total
Training:     char-level next-character prediction
Output:       char-level generation
```

```bash
cc janus.c -O2 -lm -o janus
./janus --train shakespeare.txt --steps 5000 --lr 3e-4
./janus --generate "To be or not" --load janus.bin
./janus   # interactive mode
```

### `janus-hybrid.c` — BPE Training + Char-Level Output (THE PRESSURE)
The architectural pressure variant. Trains on BPE tokens (subword units, 512 vocab) but generates output through char-level (256 vocab) decoding. This creates compression/expansion tension — thinking in concepts but speaking letter by letter.

```
Training:     BPE tokens → next-BPE prediction (512 vocab)
Output:       char-level generation (256 vocab) — THE PRESSURE
Parameters:   ~10.5M × 2 matrices
```

The pressure forces each character to be precise — the model's conceptual (BPE) understanding must compress through a char-level bottleneck.

```bash
cc janus-hybrid.c -O2 -lm -o janus-hybrid
./janus-hybrid --train shakespeare.txt --steps 5000
```

### `janus-bpe.c` — Pure BPE
Pure BPE version — BPE in, BPE out. No char-level pressure. Same hybrid attention, same physics.

```
Training/Output: BPE tokens (512 vocab)
Parameters:      ~10.5M × 2 matrices
```

```bash
cc janus-bpe.c -O2 -lm -o janus-bpe
./janus-bpe --train shakespeare.txt --steps 5000
```

### `metajanus.c` — Janus Attention Only
Demonstration of the novel Janus self-resonance attention mechanism in isolation. Like `rrpram.c` demonstrates RRPRAM alone, `metajanus.c` uses only Janus attention — no QKV, no RRPRAM. Pure introspective self-resonance.

Also features enhanced MetaJanus with internal prophecy: predicts expected entropy before each generation and evaluates accuracy afterward.

```
Architecture: T=256, E=384, H=6, D=64, B=6, M=1024
Attention:    Janus only (echo through own weights)
Parameters:   ~10.03M × 2 matrices = ~20.06M total
Output:       char-level
```

```bash
cc metajanus.c -O2 -lm -o metajanus
./metajanus --train shakespeare.txt --steps 5000
./metajanus --generate "hello world"
```

- Simultaneous bidirectional generation (interleaved forward + backward)
- All AML physics, Calendar Drift, MetaJanus, Kuramoto chambers, dual matrices
- Training with Chuck optimizer (macro patience, stagnation noise)
- Save/load weights via pickle (`nanojanus.weights.pkl`)
- BPE encoding verified identical to HTML version

### `nanojanus.txt` — Vocabulary File
1984 words organized in 29 semantic categories (body, nature, emotion, time, society, abstract, action, material, food, architecture, relationship, philosophy, music, weather, ritual, labor, geometry, animal, textile, transport, domestic, communication, medical, cosmic, bureaucracy, mythic, textual, psychological, final stratum). One word per line.

Used by both `nanojanus.html` and `nanojanus.py`. The word count (1984) matches [Penelope](https://github.com/ariannamethod/1984) — a deliberate design choice.

## Parameter Calculations

For janus.c (char-level, ~1.2MB Shakespeare dataset):

```
Token embedding:    256 × 288          = 73,728
Position embedding: 256 × 288          = 73,728

Per block (×6):
  RMSNorm:         288                 = 288
  Q,K,V weights:   3 × 6 × 288 × 48   = 248,832
  RRPRAM Wr:       6 × 288 × 256       = 442,368
  RRPRAM Vr:       6 × 288 × 48        = 82,944
  Janus Wj:        288 × 288           = 82,944
  Hybrid gates:    6 × 3               = 18
  Output Wo:       288 × 288           = 82,944
  RMSNorm:         288                 = 288
  SwiGLU gate:     288 × 768           = 221,184
  SwiGLU up:       288 × 768           = 221,184
  SwiGLU down:     768 × 288           = 221,184
  Block total:                         = 1,604,178
  ×6 blocks:                           = 9,625,068

Final RMSNorm:     288                 = 288
Output projection: 288 × 256           = 73,728

Single matrix total:                   ≈ 9,846,540 params (~9.85M)
Dual matrices:     × 2                 ≈ 19,693,080 params (~19.7M)
Model file (f32):                      ≈ 78.8 MB
```

This scaling follows the same ratio as [Dubrovsky](https://github.com/ariannamethod/dubrovsky) (9.5M params for ~1.17MB dataset), appropriate for ~1MB Shakespeare-scale training data.
